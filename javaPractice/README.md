## Hello Program

**File**: `hello/Hello.java`

This is a simple Java program that prompts the user for their name and then greets them with a personalized message.

### Example

To run the Hello program, execute:

```shell
javac Hello.java
java Hello
```

**Output**:

```
Hi, what is your name?
John
Hello John!
```

## Addition Program

**File**: `add/Add.java`

This program provides three methods to add numbers: integers, floats, and any type. It prompts the user for input and displays the sum.

### Example

To run the Addition program, execute:

```shell
javac Add.java
java Add
```

**Output**:

```
First number:
5
Second number:
3
The sum is 8.0
```

## Crypto Program

**File**: `crypto/Crypto.java`

This program provides a menu to encrypt or decrypt a phrase using a simple substitution cipher.

### Example

To run the Crypto program, execute:

```shell
javac Crypto.java
java Crypto
```

**Output**:

```
1. Encrypt
2. Decrypt
0. Quit
Enter your choice: 1
Please enter unencrypted phrase
HELLO
UBWK
```

## Change Maker Program

**File**: `changeMaker/ChangeMaker.java`

The Change Maker program calculates how much change to return for a given purchase price and cash tendered, breaking it down into various denominations.

### Example

To run the Change Maker program, execute:

```shell
javac ChangeMaker.java
java ChangeMaker
```

**Output**:

```
Price of the item:
1.75
Cash tendered:
5.00
Change: 3.25
Change Left: 325
...
```

## Loop Programs

### While Loop

**File**: `loop/WhileLoop.java`

This program demonstrates a while loop that continues prompting the user until they provide the correct answer.

### Example

To run the While Loop program, execute:

```shell
javac WhileLoop.java
java WhileLoop
```

**Output**:

```
When did Kenya gain its independence?
1960
When did Kenya gain its independence?
1963
Good job!
```

### For Loops

**File**: `loop/ForLoops.java`

This program demonstrates various types of for loops, including counting upwards, counting backwards, and counting by increments of five.

### Example

To run the For Loops program, execute:

```shell
javac ForLoops.java
java ForLoops
```

**Output**:

```
Ordinary for loop
0
1
...
Counting backwards
10
9
...
Counting by 5
0
5
...
```
